==================

Test Data Generator

datagenerator.rb contains the Datagenerator class which can be used to generate test data from both internal 
static arrays of names, places and things as well as generated numeric and alphabetic fields.  It can generate ssn-like fields and
phone-numbers.

dg is a script utility that includes that class and can be used at the command line.
